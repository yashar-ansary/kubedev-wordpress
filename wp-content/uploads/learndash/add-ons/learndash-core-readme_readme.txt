== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.1.3 = 
Important security update: please update immediately.

== FAQ ==

= Do I need to update? =

It is always recommended to update. However given the nature of WordPress and the option to have many other plugins installed, custom code, etc. it is possible that a conflict would arise. This is why we always recommend testing the update on a development environment first. 

= Why am I getting an error notice when trying to update? =

If you are getting an error while trying to update your version of LearnDash LMS, verify that your license is still valid. 

Both your license key and email address should be entered via LEARNDASH LMS > SETTINGS > LMS LICENSE. You should then see a "Your license is valid" message appear. 

If not, you can find your correct information via our [Support Site](https://support.learndash.com/articles/my-downloads/).

If your license has expired, you can purchase a new one [here](https://www.learndash.com/pricing-and-purchase/).

= What will happen to my customizations when updating? =

As long as the customizations were not done directly in the core LearnDash plugin files, there should be no problem. We provide many template files and hooks for this purpose.
