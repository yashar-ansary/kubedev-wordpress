<p>What came first, the <a href="http://www.learndash.com/lms-plugin-membership-plugin-or-both/">membership plugin or the LMS</a>? We get questions about both constantly. Our users want to know if our LMS will protect their content the way a membership plugin does, or they want to know if they need a membership plugin to manage the users on their course. Sometimes they’ve just heard the phrase “membership plugin” mentioned so many times that they are convinced they must need it—even though they don’t really know what it is.</p>
<p>Membership is a big part of online learning, but it’s not integral to it. At the same time, many users can get the key benefits of a membership plugin without needing to install one on their site. But there are also cases where only a membership plugin will do, and educators have to understand what those situations are in order to make the best choices for their course and for their learners.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s jump in and take a closer look.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the difference between a membership site and an LMS?</h3>
<p>Membership sites and LMSs have a lot in common—enough so that many people get them confused. However, despite the extensive overlap, there are some use cases wherein you might need an LMS, but not a membership plugin, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are offering an open course that anyone can take without having to formally register, you wouldn’t need a membership site. For example, if you’ve ever filled out an online personality quiz, or taken part in an informal online survey, you’ve used the same quiz functionality offered by an LMS like LearnDash.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some groups have extensive resources that they want to keep gated, but don’t require any quiz functions. These might include private archives or compilations of professional resources. In this case, the organizers are using membership functions, but without the features of an LMS.</p>
<p>However, if you are offering an online course that uses the lesson hierarchy and assessment tools of an LMS, but also want to sell memberships to your course content, then you’ll need something more. Fortunately, LearnDash has the content protection as well as the LMS features you need to create a course.</p>
<h3>How to use LearnDash as a membership plugin.</h3>
<p>We recently announced that <a href="https://www.learndash.com/membership/">LearnDash had expanded its group function</a> such that it now operates as a full-blown membership plugin. This means that, if you want to create a membership course with multiple levels of content access, you can now do that completely within LearnDash. To understand how, let’s discuss a few of the core features of any good membership plugin.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">Content access.</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">To be clear, LearnDash has always offered content protection—otherwise, our users wouldn’t be able to sell access. In controlling access, users have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>An open course doesn’t require membership or registration. It can be useful to have some courses on your site open, as a marketing tool to familiarize potential learners with your course.</li>
<li>A free course requires users to create a user account and register. This is a more valuable marketing tool than an open course, because you can then follow-up with learners about course offers.</li>
<li>This option requires users to create a user account and register, and places all content behind a paywall. Only users who have registered and paid can access closed content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Note: LearnDash includes two other access settings, “Buy Now” and “Recurring.” However, these cannot be used with shopping carts or other membership plugins, although they will still protect content access.</em></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">User roles.</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">One of the most important features a membership plugin can offer is the ability to control the user permissions of various members. User permissions in LearnDash use WordPress’s existing user management systems, which allow you to manage user roles from their profile and assign them different attributes. Users can be assigned more than one role at a time, which can help you fine-tune their permissions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In LearnDash, two user roles are particularly important:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Group user.</strong> When a learner is enrolled into a group, they become a group user. This means they will have access to other courses within their group or subgroup.</li>
<li><strong>Group leader.</strong> A group leader has management control over their groups, including adding and removing members. An admin can even assign group leaders the ability to create their own courses!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">Group hierarchy.</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Finally, LearnDash’s group function allows users to create hierarchies within their group structures, which can further control who has access to a certain course. If, for instance, you wanted to offer a course with content accessible to all registrants, but then also divide users into distinct cohorts, you would be able to do that by creating a subgroup.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In this arrangement, learners who had been placed into a subgroup would have access to all content in the umbrella group as well as content in their specific subgroup. However, a group manager who had been put in charge of that subgroup would only be able to manage learners within that subgroup, but not in the larger umbrella group unless given permission.</p>
<p>These features cover the most common scenarios that we encounter from our users. That said, LearnDash does not cover every use cases, and there are instances where working with a membership plugin can be a better solution.</p>
<h3>Using LearnDash <em>with</em> a membership plugin.</h3>
<p>Every day, users come to us with new use cases that we could never have predicted, and we can’t design our plugin to meet them all. Fortunately, because we run on WordPress, our users aren’t restricted by this. If they have another membership plugin they choose to use for whatever reason, they can still build it into their site. Here are some of the popular options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wpusermanager.com/">WP User Manager</a>.</strong> This plugin isn’t a full membership plugin, because it doesn’t involve any payment options. However, it does allow you to establish a user directory through which you can control access.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://memberpress.com/">MemberPress</a>.</strong> MemberPress offers lots of access controls as well as coupons, reporting tools, and Zapier integration.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/">Paid Membership Pro</a>.</strong> Restrict content by type, even down to the level of single pages. Offer unlimited membership levels and multi-tiered membership.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://member.wishlistproducts.com/">Wishlist Member</a>.</strong> Wishlish Member offer flexible content protection, including archiving tools to encourage users to maintain their subscriptions, and partial display options to give un-registered users a sneak peak at your content without offering full access.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://restrictcontentpro.com/">Restrict Content Pro</a>.</strong> This plugin provides a lot of integrations along with membership levels, a custom dashboard, and prorated upgrades and downgrades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership courses give you more control over how you manage your community.</h3>
<p>The great value membership courses bring to educators is that they create structure and continuity for learners. When a learner creates a user account, it gives them a tool for managing their user profiles, checking their account history, and accessing past purchases. It also gives course creators the ability to contact those learners with more courses, expand or restrict their access, and learn about how their learners engage with their course material.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use LearnDash to manage your learner membership or a 3rd party membership plugin to expand your capabilities, having these capabilities will help you create a robust community for your course that will serve you well for years to come.</p>

<p>So, you’ve created a course on LearnDash. Next you probably want to know how to sell it, right? Your first steps will be to set up the order fulfillment system that will allow you to list courses as products, have a checkout process, and get paid. And for many of our users, the first and most obvious choice is WooCommerce.</p>
<p>As perhaps the most popular e-commerce plugin on WordPress, WooCommerce offers a robust system for monetizing your course content. You can use it to sell subscriptions to your course, customize the checkout process with special offers, and send follow-up emails to customers.</p>
<p>However, you can take things a step further by adding automations to your sales process with Zapier. By selecting triggers and corresponding actions, you can create interlocking workflows that will practically sell courses for you. In fact, once you get your WooCommerce and Zapier accounts set up, the configurations you can set up to sell more courses are practically limitless. Here’s how you get started.</p>
<h3>1. Set up WooCommerce on your LearnDash site.</h3>
<p>First off, you will need to have a valid licenses for LearnDash and an account with WooCommerce (you can have a free account, but some services, like Subscriptions, are paid). For the full setup process, you can read our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/woocommerce/">WooCommerce for LearnDash integration docs</a>. In the meantime, here are the basics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/woocommerce/">WooCommerce for LearnDash</a> add-on from you WordPress admin area, just as you would any other WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>In your WooCommerce settings, disable guest checkout options, but keep the option for customers to create an account during checkout.</li>
<li>Create products for your courses in WooCommerce. If you want to offer course bundles, you can do so by choosing multiple courses from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>In LearnDash, navigate to Course Access Settings, set the Access Mode to “Closed,” and paste the URL for your WooCommerce product in the Button URL field.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are additional steps you can take to further customize your course product offerings and the checkout process, but for now this will allow you to sell your LearnDash courses using WooCommerce.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Link your LearnDash to Zapier.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next step is to connect your LearnDash account to Zapier. You’ll need a Zapier account to do this, but you can use either the free or paid version. Again, we have <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/zapier/">support documentation for our Zapier for LearnDash add-on</a>, which you should review if you have any trouble setting it up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Getting started with Zapier is actually faster than with WooCommerce. You simply need to install the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/zapier-integration/">Zapier for LearnDash add-on</a> just as you did for the WooCommerce plugin in the previous section, and you’re ready to start making Zaps.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. Set up your Zapier triggers and actions.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">With both WooCommerce and Zapier now integrated with LearnDash, you can begin creating the automations that will connect the dots in your marketing, sales, and enrollment processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the list of Zapier triggers, choose the appropriate WooCommece action. For instance, if you’re selling a course as a product, you can select “Product,” or if you’re selling it as a subscription, you can select “Subscription.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26616" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-2.46.26-PM.png" alt="WooCommerce Zapier trigger" width="500" height="307"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next, choose the action you want Zapier to take according to the WooCommerce Trigger. The four available for LearnDash + WooCommerce include “Add to Group,” “Enroll Into Course,” “Remove From Course,” and “Remove From Group.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26617" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-2.47.50-PM.png" alt="LearnDash Zapier action" width="500" height="310"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can create multiple Zaps per action, including Zaps that are triggered by each line item in a WooCommerce order. For instance, if a user wants to purchase multiple courses, they can add each course to their shopping cart, and at checkout, Zapier can enroll them in each one. Or, if you sell a bundle of courses, you can use Zapier to add users to a group that contains the course bundle.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">How can Zapier and WooCommerce help me sell more courses?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Automating WooCommerce with Zapier is one of the most popular integrations among our users. However, there are <a href="https://www.learndash.com/18-apps-that-integrate-with-zapier-and-your-course/">many more apps</a> you can integrate with your course and Zapier to automate other functions of your course—everything from marketing emails to notification reminders to social sharing. Used together, and these apps can help you reach more customers with course content and send your sales through the roof.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A few examples of automations that work well together might include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Trigger: </strong>LearnDash Course Complete.<strong><br />
Action:</strong> Create a WooCommerce coupon and send to the learner to prompt them to sign up for a new course.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> LearnDash Lesson Complete.<br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Send a recommendation for a micro course based on that lesson’s content.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Customer Created.<br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Send an email featuring popular courses and an invitation to join your community forum.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Enrolled Into Course.<br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Send a welcome email that includes links to related courses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Automation can save you time while also improving the course experience for your learners.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It takes some time and careful planning to set up automations, but once an automation is set up it can save you hours of administrative time while improving the experiences of your learners. At the same time, automating your sales and email marketing with Zapier and WooCommerce means you can sell more courses, which will give you even more resources to work with as you improve your offerings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to automating your sales, you really can’t find a better match than Zapier and WooCommerce.</p>

<p>WordPress is the perfect tool for creating and selling online courses because it is flexible and it you own the platform. Combined with LearnDash, it&#8217;s the most flexible LMS on the market, because users can combine our course management tools with any of the plugins in the WordPress ecosystem to get exactly the results they need. However, the downside to this is that, with so many plugins available, it can sometimes be a little overwhelming.</p>
<p>One situation that can cause a lot of confusion for learners is around the use of membership plugins, with or without an LMS. You may want to host an online course, but aren&#8217;t sure if you need a membership plugin to protect the content. Or maybe you want to build a learning community based around a forum, but don&#8217;t need the quiz-building functions or lesson structures of an LMS. What should you choose?</p>
<p>If you are currently in this situation for your own online course and you are not sure how to proceed, we&#8217;re here to help you out. Assuming you are going to self-host your WordPress site, you will ultimately face the following decision for your courses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an LMS without a membership plugin</li>
<li>Use a membership plugin without an LMS</li>
<li>Use LearnDash&#8217;s advanced Groups capabilities to sell memberships</li>
<li>Combine LearnDash with a 3rd party membership plugin</li>
</ol>
<p>The solution to this problem really depends on the specifics of your project, so unfortunately there are no hard-set rules as to when to use each. However, to dig into this question further, let&#8217;s start with the most obvious question: Do you need a membership plugin?</p>
<h3>1. Use an LMS without a membership plugin</h3>
<p>First off, you should begin by asking if a membership plugin is really necessary for your course. If your main concern is content protection, you actually <strong>do not</strong> need a membership plugin at all. Our LMS will protect your content without the need of a membership plugin using our Access Settings.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that you want to sell three different courses. The content of the courses (lessons, quizzes, etc.) cannot be viewed by people who are not yet enrolled. Only people who are registered for the course can view the content. If someone purchases one course, they don&#8217;t get access to the others. They only have access to the one.</p>
<p>If your course is not free then you may be wondering how to add a pay-gate to your courses. LearnDash integrates with the following popular shopping carts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learndash.com/selling-courses-with-woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a></li>
<li>Easy Digital Downloads</li>
<li>SamCart</li>
<li>ThriveCart (beta)</li>
</ul>
<p>The WordPress shopping carts (1 and 2 above) integrate with hundreds of payment gateways. LearnDash comes with the following three payment gateways if you prefer to not use a shopping cart:</p>
<ul>
<li>​PayPal</li>
<li>Stripe</li>
<li>2Checkout</li>
</ul>
<p>You can very easily use one of these methods to accept payment. LearnDash will protect your course content without the need of a membership plugin. People who choose this approach appreciate the streamlined process for creating their course offering as it cuts back on having to learn another solution.</p>
<h3>2. Use a membership plugin without an LMS</h3>
<p>It is important to note that there are some situations when using an LMS plugin like LearnDash isn&#8217;t necessary.</p>
<p>If your project just requires that you protect a couple pages, posts, or assets on your WordPress site, then a membership plugin is all you really need. Using a learning management plugin in this case would be overkill.</p>
<p>One example would be if you have a site that includes a community forum and perhaps some valuable downloads for the members. In this case, you don&#8217;t need an a plugin like LearnDash because there isn&#8217;t a need for course enrollments, quizzing, certificates, badges, points, and learner reporting.</p>
<h3>3. Use LearnDash&#8217;s advanced Groups capabilities to sell memberships</h3>
<p>Over the years, we&#8217;ve had so many questions about membership courses that we finally built this functionality into our LMS! You can now <a href="https://www.learndash.com/membership/">use LearnDash as a membership plugin</a> without needing another outside option.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works. Using the group function, you can create groups that have access to certain courses. (Think of it like membership levels.) When a learner buys access to that group, they also get access to the courses associated with it.</p>
<p>Combine this with subscription pricing, and you get Netflix for e-learning!</p>
<p>Group membership also makes it possible to refine who has access to certain pages or resources. Want to create one group for beginners and another for professionals? No problem. Want to sell access to an advanced webinar, but only to members of a certain group? You can do that, too.</p>
<p>LearnDash even offers subgroups, so that you can add hierarchy to your group management. And, because group leaders can now create courses for their groups, you can expand your team to include managers within your office, or teachers at your school.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overview of LearnDash Groups / Memberships" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJ91pwkJgpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>4. Combine LearnDash with a 3rd party membership plugin</h3>
<p>For most of our users, our expanded groups capabilities make a 3rd party membership plugin unnecessary. However, we&#8217;re wise enough to know that we can&#8217;t plan for every use-case! There can be advantages to using LearnDash with a 3rd party membership plugin depending on your requirements, and the beauty of working in WordPress is that you can use both plugins together.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to have additional metrics on your members then using a membership plugin is a nice value-add. Many membership platforms come with their own reporting capabilities. Used in conjunction with LearnDash this gives you more insight into your users.</p>
<p>Another common scenario for using both is if you have a membership site already and just want to add some course capabilities in a more formal, organized fashion. Inserting LearnDash makes it easy to add value to your membership site by creating courses for your members to take. You don&#8217;t have to change the way you manage your members either since in this case you continue using your membership plugin.</p>
<p>LearnDash has a direct integration with the following membership solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learndash.com/memberpress-learndash">MemberPress</a></li>
<li>PaidMembershipsPro</li>
<li>Restrict Content Pro</li>
<li>Memberful</li>
<li>Wishlist Member</li>
<li>Memberium</li>
<li>UltimateMember</li>
<li>ActiveMember360</li>
<li>iMember360</li>
</ul>
<h3>As a word of caution: avoid vendor lock-in!</h3>
<p>Learning programs can vary in requirements and sometimes those requirements change. With LearnDash you can start your program with any of the options above and freely switch as needed.</p>
<p>One thing I know after over a decade in the e-learning industry is that learning programs and online courses are not one-size-fits all. Learning evolves, and so do requirements.</p>
<p>Whether you use LearnDash or not, I <em>strongly</em> encourage you to avoid any solution that advocates using a single e-commerce platform or method for content protection. In the same vein, be cautious of any solution that is billed as &#8220;<a href="http://www.learndash.com/the-dangerous-myth-of-the-all-in-one-lms/">all-in-one</a>.&#8221; Rarely is this even true, but assuming it is then that means you&#8217;re locked-in as well. You don&#8217;t want to take on this kind of risk. I have seen this cause people major headaches over the years.</p>

<p>When most course creators start building content, it’s because they want to turn their expertise in a particular field into a profitable business model. However, what they don’t sign up for is all the administrative work that goes on behind the scenes to keep it all running. These tasks are often tedious and time consuming, and if a course creator can’t keep up with them all, it can lead to missed communications, lost sales, and poor customer reviews.</p>
<p>Fortunately, automation is here to save the day.</p>
<p>The fastest, simplest way to automate course tasks is through our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/zapier-integration/">Zapier add-on</a>. Zapier is an app that allows users to set up “triggers” (such as a customer filling out a form or a learner completing a course), along with automated actions (such as adding a learner to a mailing list, or assigning them a membership rank).</p>
<p>There’s a lot to explore here, but if you want an idea for how these could be used in your course, here are eighteen apps that integrate with Zapier, and through Zapier to your course website <a href="https://www.learndash.com/zapier/">via LearnDash and WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>You can format your triggers and actions in numerous different ways, but we’ve listed a couple ideas with each integration to give you some inspiration.</p>
<h3>E-Commerce &amp; Payment Processing</h3>
<p>First things first: you want to make money off your course, you have the be able to process payments, right? We offer a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/woocommerce/">WooCommerce integration</a> that, combined with your Zapier integration, makes it easier for users to connect payment and enrollment. However, you can also base payment on transactions with various payment processors, such as Stripe or PayPal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WooCommerce.</strong> Automatically enroll learners in your course after purchase or un-enroll them when they cancel their subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe.</strong> Add new accounts to your contacts.</li>
<li><strong>PayPal.</strong> Add new sales to Google Sheets to track income.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Membership sites are a huge part of many online courses. If you’re using a membership plugin, you can add nuance to your email marketing automations by triggering them once a learner reaches an enrollment level. You can also automate the membership level itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wishlist Member.</strong> Assign members a level when they enroll. Send them a marketing prompt when they reach a new level.</li>
<li><strong>MemberPress.</strong> This integration is still in process, but if you have an account you can get early access to see what’s available.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forms</h3>
<p>Forms are an integral part of any site—and e-learning sites more than most. While Zapier offers several integrations for form plugins, two of the most popular options for WordPress sites are Gravity Forms and Ninja Forms. You can connect Zapier to both of these apps and choose automations based on which form fields a user filled out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gravity Forms.</strong> Create leads in SalesForce with new form submissions. Add a form lead to an event.</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Forms.</strong> Add form responses to GoogleSheets. Update mailing lists in MailChimp based on form response.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p>Social media automations can help your content marketing efforts while also making it easier for you to keep up with customer service. Use Zaps to share events, blog posts, and positive reviews from customers, all while keeping a closer eye on your engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slack.</strong> Remind your team of upcoming webinar events by notifying your Slack channel. Share new Twitter mentions to Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer.</strong> Add new blog posts to your queue. Share new webinar events to your Buffer queue.</li>
<li><strong>Hootsuite.</strong> Send an automated thank you message to new followers on Twitter with a link to your starter course.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook.</strong> Publish blog posts to your Facebook page. Send new posts on your Facebook page to Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram.&nbsp;</strong>Create posts to your blog from content you share on Instagram.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter.</strong> Connect your Twitter account with your other social accounts to automatically share content. Save Twitter mentions to Google Sheets to keep track of customer satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn.</strong> Share your latest webinar events to LinkedIn. Add new connections to SalesForce as contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Webinars are a popular event option for many learners, because it helps them feel like they’re being taught by a person rather than being led through an automated system. However, there are several steps in the process of automating event sign-ups that can make this task easier for you—from automatically enrolling attendees in courses to sending them reminder emails so that they don’t forget to turn up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EventBrite.</strong> Get Slack notifications when a new attendee signs up for your webinars. Add attendees to your mailing lists.</li>
<li><strong>GoToWebinar.</strong> Add Gravity Forms registrants to your webinar event. Add new registrants to a MailChip mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Email Marketing</h3>
<p>Finally, while many email platforms include their own automations for scheduling emails, you can make these tools go even further if you link them to other automations—especially ones that have to do with learners in your course.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MailChimp.</strong> Add contacts from a sign-up form to your MailChimp mailing list. Send a welcome email to new registrants. Dripfeed marketing emails to learners who complete a course.</li>
<li><strong>Active Campaign.</strong> Add EventBrite webinar attendees to your mailing list. Add ad leads to your contact list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don’t see an app listed here? Search for it on Zapier!</h3>
<p>The apps we’ve listed here represent some of the most popular tools in the industry, but they’re not all that Zapier has to offer. Their site currently boasts over 2,000 app integrations, and that number is only growing. So if you have other apps that you prefer to use other than the ones mentioned here, there’s a good chance you can find an integration.</p>
<p>And, because Zapier integrates with WordPress, you can easily hook many of these apps up to your online course as well. With Zapier Premium, you can even set up multi-step Zaps that will trigger multiple apps for more complex automations. You can’t automate everything, but with careful planning, you can get pretty close.</p>

Here’s how to find the help you need.</h2>
<p>Over the years, we’ve seen LearnDash users create a range of courses, using our plugin in ways we would never have thought of doing ourselves. That users are continually coming up with new course ideas speaks to the importance of having a flexible LMS like LearnDash. However, it also means people are continually coming to us with new challenges that need resolution.</p>
<p>When users have a question, we want them to get the best answer possible. To that end, we’ve created a lot of resources to address user concerns—both the common questions we get every day, and more unusual questions that strike us as interesting.</p>
<p>However, with so many resources available, you may be wondering where to begin. That’s what this post is for.</p>
<h3>Should you send in a support ticket?</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the obvious question: When should you send in a support ticket?</p>
<p>We’re obviously singing our own praises here, but we have a great support team. We have team members from around the world who work hard to help support our users as best we can.</p>
<p>That said, despite our greatest efforts, sending in a support ticket is not always the right option, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your issue isn’t with the LearnDash software, we can’t help you.</li>
<li>Our support hours are 7AM – 4PM (EDT), Monday through Friday, and our target is to respond to all support tickets within one business day. So, if you send in a ticket on a Friday afternoon, you may not get a response till Monday.</li>
<li>If you don’t have a specific problem to solve but are instead looking for advice or guidance, there’s only so much our support team can do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, we’ve spent a lot of time developing resources on our support website and on our blog to help you out. And, if you have a unique problem, or if you’re still struggling to find the right answers, we have an excellent community of LearnDash users and WordPress professionals over in our LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks Facebook group that can help you out!</p>
<p>Before you head over there, however, we recommend trying to find your answer in the following areas.</p>
<h3>1. Read our support docs!</h3>

<h3>4. Search our LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks group for questions!</h3>
<p>If your question hasn’t been covered in any of our resources, we recommend looking at what our other users have to say. Our LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks group has been running for several years, and has thousands of members from around the world—both LearnDash course creators like yourself who have gone through the same process you’re experiencing, and experienced WordPress professionals.</p>
<p>Before you ask a question, it’s a good idea to search the group to see if someone else has asked something similar. There are two ways to do this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26584 size-large" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-17-at-2.02.19-PM-1024x327.png" alt="The LearnDash Tips and Tricks group menu with search bar cirlced" width="1024" height="327" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the search icon in the upper right corner of the navigation menu and type in some keywords (i.e., “hosting,” or “WooCommerce”). You’ll be able to see other posts that discuss that key term, and may find that someone has already asked your question!<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26587 size-large" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-17-at-4.32.16-PM-1024x355.png" alt="Facebook search bar showing search for &quot;hosting&quot;" width="1024" height="355" /></li>
<li>Take a look at the popular tags on the right sidebar of the group.<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26583 size-full" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-17-at-2.01.53-PM.png" alt="A screen shot of popular topics in the LearnDash Tips and Tricks forum" width="674" height="420" /></li>
</ol>
<p>These list many of the topics that have been covered in our group, and our team tags new questions as we go so that this list stays up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Join the group »</strong> <a href="https://www.learndash.com/facebook/">LearnDash Tips &amp; Tricks</a></p>
<h3>Ready to ask our LearnDash group for help?</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve done your homework, it’s time to post a question to the group. To get the best answer, it helps to give us as much detail as you can so that the group understands exactly what you’re struggling with. Here’s a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let us know where you’ve looked already!</strong> That way you won’t get a lot of answers telling you to go read a blog post that you already read or watch a webinar that you already watched.</li>
<li><strong>Let us know what solutions you’ve already tried.</strong> Knowing what you’ve done and what the results were will help us eliminate wrong solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Be as specific as you can be about your problem.</strong> Vague questions will get vague answers.</li>
<li><strong>Include screen shots!</strong> Show us what you’re seeing so we can understand what’s going on.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Still having problems? Send in a support ticket.</h3>
<p>Of course, there are some times when sending in a support ticket is the step you need to take after all. You can open a ticket at <a href="https://support.learndash.com/contact-support?fbclid=IwAR3wl99WRIxgbIgD_GeHuzbFCG-ES1p38_CtVlmOcDCIk8g4LVF9T9Az9QI">https://support.learndash.com/contact-support</a>, and one of our team will be available to help with your problem as soon as we are able. Just as in asking questions of the group, the more details you can give us (including screen shots!) the better.</p>
<p>Best of luck, and happy course creating!</p>

<h2>H5P helps instructors create interactive content for free.</h2>
<p>One of the hardest things to do in any online course is to keep learners engaged with the content.</p>
<p>If you have too many videos, it gets boring. No videos at all and it&#8217;s even worse. Images can take you only so far.</p>
<p>And while quizzes are a great way to check-in with learners, they can also become tedious if they&#8217;re used too much.</p>
<p>It is because of this that people often turn to programs like Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, and&nbsp;iSpring for creating interactive course content.</p>
<p>The problem however is that these programs come with a hefty price tag, so they aren&#8217;t accessible for every budget (with perhaps <a href="http://www.learndash.com/have-you-checked-out-ispring/">exception of iSpring</a>).</p>
<p>That is the bad news.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can create interactive content with another (free) program: <a href="http://www.h5p.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">H5p</a>.</p>
<h3>What is H5P?</h3>
<p>In a sentence: H5P makes it possible for you to create and use interactive HTML5 content.</p>
<p>This content engages learners by turning passive learning (watching videos, reading articles) into active learning (clicking on images, re-arranging pictures, answering flash cards). These simple prompts keep learners from zoning out during a lesson so that they retain more information.</p>
<p><strong>H5P includes features like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flashcards</li>
<li>Charts</li>
<li>Presentations</li>
<li>Memory games</li>
<li>Image hotspots</li>
<li>Interactive video</li>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these features is also a great value-add for your course by giving your lessons a professional polish. However, the best part of this plug-in by far is that it allows for some great use-cases that can elevate a course above the competition.</p>
<h3>What are some use cases for H5P in online courses?</h3>
<p>To get an idea for how H5P can be used in action, let&#8217;s take a look at some use-cases in a course.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Providing instruction details during a video.</strong> Videos can be great, but sometimes the instructions go by too fast, and learners can miss a stop. Interactive videos let you annotate steps so that learners can take notes without having to pause and replay a section of the video multiple times.</li>
<li><strong>Check to see if learners are following along during a presentation.</strong> Include quizzes as slides within a presentation so learners can fill in the blank or select multiple choice answers for material they just read.</li>
<li><strong>Create life-like branching scenarios for training.</strong> <a href="http://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-branching-scenarios-in-e-learning/">Branching scenarios</a> can show learners how a situation might unfold in real time. They unfold like a choose-your-own-adventure, so that learners can apply their training and see what affect their decisions might have on a situation.</li>
<li><strong>Juxtapose images to help learners compare and contrast.</strong> H5P&#8217;s juxtaposition feature lets creators layer two images on top of each other and selectively reveal one side or the other using a sliding bar. This would be a great way to show a before and after image, or to give an &#8220;x-ray&#8221; view of an object.</li>
<li><strong>Click-to-identify an object in an image.</strong> Want to help your learners identify tools for a project, or how to spot early warning signs of an illness? Use a heat map on an image and have learners click on the spot they&#8217;re supposed to find.</li>
<li><strong>Create a personality quiz for team building.</strong> Personality quizzes are popular for a lot of reasons, but they can also be a helpful way for teams to find out more about each other or to help employees or classmates find a group that they&#8217;ll feel comfortable with.</li>
</ol>
<p>H5P has over forty interaction types, each with several examples of the feature in action. <a href="https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications">Take a look for yourself</a> to see how you could put these interactive tools to work in your course.</p>
<h3>How can you install H5P on your course website?</h3>
<p>First you will need to create an account at H5P (don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s free).</p>
<p>Next, install the H5p WordPress plugin on your site and configure the necessary settings. This plugin allows you to import your H5P interactions into WordPress. For the complete step-by-step details and tutorials, <a href="https://h5p.org/documentation/setup/wordpress" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">see this article from the H5P documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Once you are done with this configuration you can now insert dynamic interactions within your LearnDash course content.</p>
<h3>Record The Results</h3>
<p>Inserting the dynamic content is one thing. Sure it&#8217;s great for the learner but you want to capture the important data. To do so, you must make sure H5P can transfer learning data to your LMS.</p>
<p>To do this you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learndash.com/work/grassblade-lrs/">GrassBlade LRS</a>&nbsp;by NextSoftwareSolutions</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uncannyowl.com/downloads/tin-canny-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tin Canny Reporting</a>&nbsp;by UnCannyOwl</li>
<li><a href="https://learning-templates.com/product/learndash-xapi/">xAPI for LearnDash</a> by Learning Templates</li>
</ul>
<p>These will record and report on all of the H5P modules included in your LearnDash courses. Your learners win because they have more interactive (engaging!) course content and you win because you get valuable insight into how your learners are performing.</p>

";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Laura Lynch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5962:"<h2>Something’s not working on your site. Is it LearnDash, or something else?</h2>
<p>We not infrequently have customers contact our support team asking for help because something with their website isn’t working. For many, the assumption is that, because LearnDash is the main plugin on their site, if something’s broken, it must be the cause.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in many cases, the issue isn’t with us. This puts us in an awkward position. On the one hand, while we never like finding out that our plugin is causing some issues, we also want to help when we can. At the same time, we simply can’t resolve a lot of problems if they don’t have anything to do with us.</p>
<p>This can be very frustrating for some people. No one likes getting the run-around, and contacting someone for support only to be told “sorry, not our problem” can leave some people feeling like there’s no one out there to help them. So, in situations like this, we usually have two pieces of advice for customers. First, they can find an experienced developer to help them resolve their problem, or second, they can run a conflict test to pinpoint the issue.</p>
<p>A conflict test is a diagnostic procedure that homes in on whatever is causing issues with your site. By stripping your site back to the basics and then gradually layering your themes and plugins back on, you can use the process of elimination to spot where things go wrong. Here’s now it works.</p>
<h3>1. Backup your site before you do any testing.</h3>
<p>First and foremost, make a backup of your site before you do anything. Since you’re going to be doing some serious tinkering with the functionality of your site, you want to be sure that nothing you do causes permanent loss of data or content.</p>
<p>There are several WordPress plugins that you can use to do this, such as <a href="https://ithemes.com/backupbuddy/">BackupBuddy</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a>, and in fact, you should be using them regularly to backup your site in case of an emergency.</p>
<h3>2. Temporarily revert to the default theme.</h3>
<p>Next, revert your site back to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/">Twenty Twenty</a> theme. This is the default theme for WordPress, meaning it’s nicely stripped-down, without some of the added functions and widgets that might be causing you problems. This is a solid baseline from which to begin your conflict test.</p>
<h4>Bonus tip: If you don’t want to test a live site, set up an exact replica on a dev or staging site.</h4>
<p>We mostly hear this complaint from new customers who are just starting out with LearnDash and have installed a lot of things all at once. Customers who have been with us for a while don’t usually assume something is wrong with LearnDash the minute something stops working on their site.</p>
<p>However, it does sometimes happen that a long-time customer spots an error and has reason to believe that LearnDash isn’t working. They may have already launched their site, and are wary of conducting this test while their site is live.</p>
<p>In this case, we recommend creating an exact replica of your current site in a safe testing environment. If you have a staging site you can use that, or you can have your host clone your existing site and set it up at a subdomain, such as dev.yourdomain.com. This way you can test to your heart’s content without worrying that you will negatively impact your site.</p>
<h3>3. Deactivate all your plugins except LearnDash.</h3>
<p>With your website set back to the default, it’s time to start deactivating plugins. Since you don’t know which is causing the problem, you want to turn them all off except for LearnDash. Hopefully, when you reach this point, whatever problem you were noticing has gone away. If so, you will have ruled-out LearnDash as the source of the issue.</p>
<p>However, this still doesn’t tell you what the underlying problem is. If you want to figure that out, you have to start turning things on again.</p>
<h3>4. Reactivate each plugin one at a time until you find the culprit.</h3>
<p>With your website essentially “reset,” start activating your plugins again one at a time, testing with each step to see where the issue begins. It’s likely that the issue has to do with how one of the plugins is interacting with the rest of your site. You want to isolate the problem plugin, because that will help you figure out how to move forward. (In some cases the issue could also have to do with your theme.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified which plugin is causing problems, you have a couple options. First, you could contact their support team and see if they can help you resolve the issue. Second, you can uninstall that plugin and find a different, more reliable plugin that accomplishes the same thing. And finally, you can contact a professional to work with you one-on-one to find a custom solution.</p>
<h3>If you’re running a default theme, all plugins except LearnDash are turned off, and the issue persists, let us know.</h3>
<p>It sometimes happens that a customer resets to the default theme with only LearnDash running and the problem they were experiencing earlier is still there. If you find yourself in this position, it’s time to contact us.</p>
<p>We recommend our customers do these steps any time they reach out with an error coming from an unknown source. If the problem lies with our program, we want to know! While it might seem like a lot of steps, running a conflict test is a reliable diagnostic method that can help us get to the root of the issue—and solve your problem faster that we would otherwise be able to do.</p>

";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Laura Lynch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6481:"<h2>One-on-one private sessions, tandem learning, and mentorship are all important ways to support learners.</h2>
<p>Every online educator knows how challenging it can be to help a learner cross the finish line on their course. <a href="https://www.learndash.com/why-do-learners-drop-out-of-online-courses/">Learner drop-out</a> is a consistent problem across the field, and the causes behind it are well-known. In some cases, life intervenes: a learner becomes suddenly busy, they underestimate the work it would take to complete a course, or they fall ill or have to cope with personal difficulties. (Or, thinking positively, maybe everything starts going their way and they no longer feel the burning need for your self-improvement course.)</p>
<p>More frequently, however, learners drop out of a course for preventable reasons. They become disengaged, they’ve hit a road block and can’t work around it, the online environment makes them feel lonely and alienated, or they simply lose motivation as the subject matter becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, a personal connection with someone in the course can be enough to pull them through their rough patch. This connection can come in various forms: through a private lesson, a learning buddy, or a mentor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, LearnDash supports several plugins that can facilitate tutoring sessions, tandem learning, mentorship, and community support. Here are a few of the most popular to get you started.</p>
<h3>LearnDash Private Sessions</h3>
<p>Every learner is different. They will have their own strengths and weaknesses, motivations, interests, and stumbling blocks. Because of this, online courses are rarely the hands-free source of passive income some instructors expect them to be when they start.</p>
<p>Fortunately, private tutoring sessions are hugely valuable to learners—and a benefit many are more than willing to pay for. They offer learners the opportunity to ask questions directly and get the expert feedback they need. And the more popular your course becomes, the more you can charge for them. After a while, they may be your biggest source of income.</p>
<p><a href="https://snaporbital.com/learndash-private-sessions/?source=learndash">LearnDash Private Sessons</a> is a plugin designed for instructors who want to offer that personal support to learners. Top features include file sharing, mobile-friendliness, notifications, and user control customizations.</p>
<p>This plugin is incredibly flexible. Use it to schedule a one-on-one power session, or use it as a coaching tool by creating regular check-in times with learners. You can even customize user permissions to allow qualified members of your community to become mentors themselves.</p>
<h3>LearnDash Buddy Up</h3>
<p>Sometimes, what your learners need most from your course isn’t more of <em>you</em>, but more of their peers. Specifically, they’re looking to build relationship with classmates that each can use as a mutual support to get through the course together. In a tandem learning arrangement such as this, learners can share goals, practice mutual accountability, and learn from each other as they work through difficult material.</p>
<p><a href="https://wooninjas.com/wn-products/learndash-buddy-up/">LearnDash Buddy Up</a> offers a flexible way for members to find each other and create buddy groups of one or more learners. The plugin allows for live chat, multiple group support, and membership controls.</p>
<p>Buddy Up works best when run alongside your regular course forum—it’s not a replacement. Your course forum should be a place for learners to connect with large groups of fellow learners, participate in long-running discussions, and find the peers they may want to partner with on Buddy Up.</p>
<h3>GamiPress</h3>
<p>If you’re running a course with an open community, you may want to create a way for some members to identify others as trusted guides along their learning journey. This is a less structured and more organic way of creating a mentorship program, but in a healthy community, it can be just as effective.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamipress.com/">GamiPress</a> allows you to create special badges for users who have fulfilled certain criteria on your site. You can even create more complex “quests” that involve multi-level, interactive steps.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with mentorship and community support? Well, what if you created a quest for learners who wanted to earn a Community Mentor badge? Learners who were especially motivated to achieve this badge would have to complete a certain level of courses, plus be active participants in the community forum, and have a good standing amongst their fellow learners.</p>
<p>Once they earned their mentor badge, they could earn special privileges similar to a moderator, such as a waiver on course fees. The presence of mentors in your community would give other learners a designated person to contact with questions, and the vetting process would ensure that only the learners who were most dedicated would achieve the badge.</p>
<h3>Use automation to identify learners most at risk of dropping out.</h3>
<p>Offering learners an opportunity to connect may prevent them from dropping out of your course, but sometimes learners need a nudge to even do that. LearnDash metrics help you spot learners who are falling behind—such as those who go several days without logging in, or who have failed a quiz several times in a row.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/notifications/">set up triggers</a> within the course to send an automated email when this happens suggesting a possible way to help. If a learner seems to be struggling with the material, they may be a good candidate for a private lesson. But if a learner hasn’t been logging in, or isn’t spending a lot of time on the site when they do, they may benefit more from a learning partner or a mentor.</p>
<p>The more you can tailor your intervention to the learner’s needs, the more success you will have in <a href="https://www.learndash.com/3-tips-for-online-learner-engagement/">keeping them engaged</a> with your course.</p>

<p>Every teacher knows how hard it can be to hold the attention of students in a classroom. Absorbing new information is mentally taxing, which means that it can be difficult for learners to maintain their attention, even if the content is interesting to them. Classroom teachers, instructors, and professors have various techniques at their disposal to reengage a class when they sense they are losing their audience, but online education offers no such feedback.</p>
<p>While educators create course content envisioning learners who will studiously and seamlessly flow from one lesson to the next, the reality is very different. Online learners are beset by far more distractions than what is typical in a course. Not only are they learning at home, where families and personal interests are also vying for their attention, but the entire rest of the internet is just a browser tab away. The more cluttered your own course design is, the more opportunities they have to become distracted.</p>
<p>And as we all know, distractions snowball until the entire block of time they had set aside for learning has evaporated.</p>
<p>For many learners, this experience is exhausting and demoralizing. It can slow down their progress through the course, make it more difficult to remember what they’ve learned, and eventually cause them to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-to-improve-online-course-completion-rates/">quit the course</a>.</p>
<h3>On-screen distractions impede learners in the following ways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>They subconsciously add to the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-understanding-cognitive-load-can-improve-your-course/">memory burden</a> as learners work overtime to ignore periphery inputs.</li>
<li>They tempt learners to navigate away from the key learning area.</li>
<li>They create confusion for learners about where to go next and what area of the lesson to pay attention to.</li>
<li>They break concentration, leaving learners with an opening to leave the course entirely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/best-wordpress-lms-plugin/">LearnDash 3.0</a> comes with a new feature that is unique among industry LMSs: Focus Mode. Instructors can apply this setting from the back end of a course so that on certain pages or in certain lessons, unnecessary side bars and navigation become hidden, so that learners can concentrate on learning. Here’s just a few of the features we implemented, and why we believe they’re going to be a big help to your learners.</p>
<h3>1. Main navigation, sidebars, and footers are all removed from the screen.</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, removing navigation is a dangerous move for usability purposes. You never want your users to feel lost, and that’s exactly what navigation is supposed to prevent. But navigation menus, sidebars, and footers are also the primary culprits when it comes to cluttered and overly distracting layouts.</p>
<p>By clearing this navigation away, we’re creating a dedicated study space for the learners where we want them to remain until they complete the lesson. The purpose of Focus Mode is to help learners stay in place, not to offer them easy exit points.</p>
<h3>2. Course navigation remains in place, but can be collapsed.</h3>
<p>That said, we don’t want Focus Mode to be so minimalist that it fails to provide learners with necessary navigation. Because of this, we kept the course navigation as the new sidebar, so that learners can easily access move through the lesson and still have access to the materials they need.</p>
<p>If even this is too much of a visual distraction learners can easily collapse the course navigation to the side and expand it again later when they need to move to a different page.</p>
<h3>3. Focus Mode menu allows learners to return to main course at any time.</h3>
<p>While we removed most of the navigation, we don’t want learners to feel trapped. The goal of Focus Mode isn’t to take away all of a learner’s choices as they use the site, simply to make it a click removed so that they’re not constantly bombarded by choices as they’re trying to learn.</p>
<p>Learners can access the Focus Mode menu by hovering over their profile image. The menu items that appear can be customized, and you can add as many items as you feel will benefit your learners.</p>
<h3>4. CTA buttons are paired down to “Complete” and “Next Lesson.”</h3>
<p>An abundance of calls-to-action (CTAs) are one of the worst distractions in a normal study mode. The whole purpose of a CTA is to try to convince a learner to take <em>action</em>—usually by clicking a button. They’re designed to be bold, enticing, and attention-grabbing, which is exactly what you <em>don’t</em> want.</p>
<p>Because of this, we’ve reduced the number of on-screen primary CTAs to just two: the buttons for “Complete” and “Next Lesson.” This keeps the learner focused on moving forward through the course rather than leaving the lesson to go make a post in the community forum, or to read a blog, or to watch a video.</p>
<h3>5. Progress bar remains in place.</h3>
<p>One final thing we kept in place: the progress bar. Far from being a distraction, the progress bar is a subtle motivation to learners, as well as a visual feedback mechanism that helps them know how far they have to go in the course.</p>
<p>Again, this may seem trivial, but if you’ve ever struggled to get through reading an ebook, you may recall how unnerving it was not to know how far you had to go to complete it. The <em>lack</em> of a progress bar can be a distraction for many learners, because it makes them feel lost. Seeing that they’re making progress helps keep them on track.</p>
<h3>Keeping your learners focused will help them complete your course, and will raise their satisfaction with their experience.</h3>
<p>Removing visual clutter on the screen may seem like a small step, but it has a big impact on how learners feel when they are in your course. A visually clean course space in an online classroom is to a cluttered one what studying in a library is to studying in the food court of the local mall. It puts the learner in the right frame of mind and keeps them there while they work through the course. Learners are not only less distracted, they also are feel less exhausted because they won’t have spent so much energy maintaining their concentration.</p>
<p>If you are curious to learn more about how Focus Mode works, you can find a detailed description of its features and how to set it up on your course in the documentation for LearnDash 3.0.

<h2>Maximizing customer conversion rates for your LearnDash courses has never been so easy!</h2>
<p>I was first introduced to CartFlows last year by Adam from <a href="http://wpcrafter.com">WPCrafter</a>.</p>
<p>Known perhaps foremast for his YouTube channel, Adam has an attention to detail and excellence that is increasingly more rare these days. Along with his co-founder Sujay Pawar (the man behind the popular <a href="https://support.learndash.com/astra-theme">Astra theme</a>), Adam has made CartFlows the go-to WordPress plugin for creating impressive sales pages, checkout forms, up-sells, cross-sells, and more.</p>
<p><strong>But you want to know the best thing about CartFlows?</strong> You get all of these great features (for FREE) and it integrates with LearnDash – making it possible to create professionally optimized checkout experiences for your online courses!</p>
<h3>Using CartFlows with LearnDash.</h3>
<p>There are a few things you will need in place first in order to harness the power of LearnDash &amp; CartFlows. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>LearnDash LMS</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cartflows/">CartFlows</a></li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>LearnDash-WooCommerce Integration</li>
<li>Page Builder (CartFlows supports Gutenberg, Elementor, BeaverBuilder, and Thrive Architect)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you create your checkout experience in CartFlows, the first thing you will need to do is have your LearnDash course created. Once that is done, you are ready to get everything configured. The video above goes into the details for this process, but at a high-level it is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create your WooCommerce product</li>
<li>Link your LearnDash courses to the product (see instructions here)</li>
<li>Create your Flow in CartFlows</li>
<li>Link your CartFlow sequence to the course</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have used WooCommerce before then the first two steps above will take about five minutes. The best part is you don’t need to worry about creating a detailed (or even pretty) description for the product in WooCommerce. CartFlows will take care of that!</p>
<p>Speaking of CartFlows, it’s at this point you are ready to create your checkout sequence. The video above demonstrates how to do this with pre-made templates, but if you want more instructional material on this process then I recommend you have a look at the <a href="https://cartflows.com/docs/">CartFlows help docs</a>.</p>
<p>The very last part in this process is linking up your new CartFlow to your LearnDash course. This is done by configuring only two settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set your course Access Mode to “Closed”</li>
<li>Select the flow you just created in CartFlows from the MENU NAME</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>Now, if someone visits your LearnDash course page and they are not yet enrolled then they will be automatically taken to your optimized checkout process in CartFlows!</p>
<h3>CartFlows gives you the power of a hosted e-commerce platform, but without the restrictions or high monthly costs.</h3>
<p>When it comes to e-commerce you have a seemingly infinite number of possibilities. Ultimately you will choose a solution that falls into one of two categories…</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted solution that you don’t own and can’t control</li>
<li>Your own configuration on WordPress where you own the content and set-up</li>
</ul>
<p>While it may seem like the second choice is the obvious option, the hosted software services do provide value in the right contexts. These are often massive, venture funded offerings, and this allows them the opportunity to come out with very impressive functionality.</p>
<p>No where is this more apparent than when it comes to e-commerce, and customizing a checkout process. Hosted shopping carts have always boasted the most impressive check-out experiences, designed to maximize conversions and the average dollar per customer.</p>
<p>But this comes at a cost.</p>
<p>You don’t own the platform nor the customer data. You are restricted in functionality. And, you pay a hefty fee per month.</p>
<p>With CartFlows you get all the benefits of hosted e-commerce solutions but without these downsides. You can then take these benefits and apply them directly to your LearnDash courses!</p>
