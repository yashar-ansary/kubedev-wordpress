<h2>How to create an effective email newsletter that won’t end up in the spam folder.</h2>



<p>Email newsletters are a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-popular-email-marketing-services-compared/">popular marketing tactic</a> for a good reason: subscribers like them, and they&#8217;re effective. However, this is only true if marketers follow the right best practices. All email newsletters are not created equal, and it&#8217;s far too easy for businesses to cut corners in the hope of reaching a wider audience, only to be disappointed when their spam reports go through the roof.</p>



<p>For online educators, creating an email newsletter can be a valuable tool. But if you want to avoid the pitfalls of unsuccessful newsletters, it&#8217;s wise to follow these <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">best practices</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Tell your subscribers what they’re signing up for.</h3>



<p>First of all, to gain newsletter subscriptions, you&#8217;ll need to convince visitors to sign up to your mailing list. Few people will hand over their email address for no reason, and even if they do, they may be unhappy to discover themselves on your mailing list without their permission.</p>



<p>If you want to win over subscribers, make a clear and inviting statement about what your mailing list provides. It can be something as simple as: &#8220;To hear about our latest course updates and study tips, sign up for our weekly newsletter.&#8221; In one short sentence, this describes the frequency and general content of the newsletter. It doesn&#8217;t have to be more complicated than that.</p>



<h3>2. Use reCAPTCHA and double opt-in.</h3>



<p>Most of us know CAPTCHA as those squiggly words in a box that are hard to read and frustrating to use. A better option is reCAPTCHA, a user-friendly version developed by Google that uses check boxes or simple math problems (think: 1+1=?). These will limit the number of fake bot subscriptions and keep your lists healthy.</p>



<p>Similarly, double opt-ins are insurance to make sure the people who subscribed to your list actually want to be on it. Some marketers avoid them in the belief that the added step will scare away subscribers, but there aren&#8217;t many people who will change their minds or be overly deterred by verifying their subscription. And if they are, it&#8217;s probably as sign they weren&#8217;t all that interested in the first place.</p>



<h3>3. Be transparent about how you will use their data.</h3>



<p>Data transparency is a growing concern, particularly when it comes to online marketing. The Greater Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) from the EU stipulate that companies must be open with their users about how the data of EU citizens are being used. This could apply to small companies (which include certification businesses) if they have subscribers who are EU citizens.</p>



<p>To be safe, make sure that anyone who subscribes to your list understands that you will be using their email for marketing purposes, and that you won&#8217;t be sharing their data (which includes their email address) in any illicit way.</p>



<h3>4. Test subject lines and introductions.</h3>



<p>When you write your emails, use different subject lines with each newsletter. If you use the same subject line every time, your subscribers will start to ignore them. While you&#8217;re at it, test out different kinds of subject lines. Avoid using words like &#8220;free,&#8221; &#8220;now,&#8221; exclamation marks, or anything else that sounds like spam. Similarly, test out the opening line of your email to see what holds attention.</p>



<h3>5. Make sure they are mobile friendly.</h3>



<p>About two thirds of email in the US is opened and read on smart phones. This means that if your email is formatted in a way that doesn&#8217;t read well on mobile, it won&#8217;t serve your readers. To keep your emails mobile-friendly, avoid overly-formatted templates. Keep your subjects about 40–50 characters long, your images under 600px wide, and stick to single-column formats.</p>



<h3>6. Use segmentation to deliver more targeted messages.</h3>



<p>Email segmentation means splitting a list into sub segments to target more niche audiences. For instance, if you have two or three online programs on your site but only one general email list, you could segment that list so that if you wanted to send out a newsletter that was about only one of those programs, you would only be emailing learners of that course.</p>



<p>That said, you have to be careful with segmentation. You can&#8217;t take those users off the list they signed up for and move them to one they didn&#8217;t sign up for. If someone signed up for your weekly email newsletter about course updates and study tips and suddenly starts receiving daily sales messages, they&#8217;ll understandably feel tricked.</p>



<h3>7. Balance your content to be 90% informational.</h3>



<p>Email newsletters are an excellent way to grow a sales list, but they should primarily be about providing your subscribers with the kind of information that will give them a reason to stay. Very few people subscribe to an email list so that they can receive promotional emails every morning. Instead, they&#8217;re looking for something of value. That&#8217;s what you have to give them.</p>



<h3>8. Let your subscribers adjust content type and frequency.</h3>



<p>Give your subscribers an easy way to manage the kinds of emails they receive. If you&#8217;re using list segmentation properly, then they shouldn&#8217;t be receiving anything they didn&#8217;t sign up for. However, they may decide after some time that they want to receive fewer emails, or only emails on certain topics. Let your subscribers see which segmented lists they&#8217;re on, and make it easy for them to remove themselves from those lists.</p>



<h3>9. Make unsubscribing easy.</h3>



<p>There may come a time when someone who was once a subscriber no longer wants to receive your emails. You&#8217;ve probably been that person yourself on someone else&#8217;s marketing list. It&#8217;s not a good use of your time to continue marketing to people who don&#8217;t want to hear from you, and it&#8217;s likely to lead to resentment if you do. Your goal in creating an email newsletter is to have a list of people who want to hear from you—not one that&#8217;s full of disinterested leads who delete your emails unread whenever they land in their inbox.</p>



<p>To build the list you want, make it easy for users to unsubscribe. Put the button in the footer of your email, and don&#8217;t try to bury it in the fine print where it&#8217;s hard to locate. When they do go to unsubscribe, don&#8217;t burden them with questions or ask them to stay—just let them unsubscribe.</p>



<h3>10. Deliver on your promises.</h3>



<p>Creating an email newsletter is one thing. Sustaining it is another. It&#8217;s far too easy to put a subscribe button on your website and never do anything with it. Worse, you may collect a few hundred emails over the course of the year, but by the time you go to send them a newsletter they could have gotten second thoughts, changed email addresses, or forgotten they signed up in the first place.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re going to do your email newsletters well, deliver what you say you will. If you say you&#8217;re sending a weekly update, send it once a week. If you say it&#8217;s going to be about your courses and study tips, make sure it is. And if you start to change your newsletter to something different, tell your subscribers and ask them to sign up for the new list. Those who still want to hear from you will come along.</p>

<h2>You’re selling an online course. Does your copy focus on what your course offers, or what your course can help learners achieve?</h2>



<p>Recently, I wrote a blog post on <a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-tips-for-writing-better-sales-copy-for-your-online-course/">copywriting tips </a>that can help online educators sell their courses more effectively. One of the points I touched on was the difference between course benefits and features, and why speaking to course benefits is a good way to get learners interested in your course.</p>



<p>The difference between the two can be nuanced, so I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss it further, especially as understanding your course benefits is key to successful marketing messaging on a high level, and features are critical to helping you close.</p>



<p>In marketing speak, the difference between a &#8220;benefit&#8221; and a &#8220;feature&#8221; is that the benefit is a learner&#8217;s end goal. Features are how the learner will get there.</p>



<p>For LearnDash, we might say that a benefit of our plugin is that educators will be able to create online courses, earn an income that will give them more financial freedom, and share something they&#8217;re passionate about with the world. Those are all benefits that a successful educator can gain through building a course with our plugin. The features we offer to help them do that include things like &#8220;advanced quizzes&#8221; or &#8220;dripfeed content.&#8221;</p>



<p>Educators will need to understand both their benefits and their features in order to market their course. But knowing when and how to use them has a huge impact on how many learners a course will attract, and how effective an educator will be at selling to them. Here&#8217;s why.</p>



<h3>1. Learners need a reason to care about the course before they will care about its features.</h3>



<p>Imagine trying to sell a course by telling someone about all the amazing webinars, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-use-cases-for-branching-scenarios-in-online-learning/">branching scenarios</a>, and quizzes you&#8217;re going to offer, but without mentioning what your course is about? It sounds ridiculous, but it&#8217;s a problem many course creators fall into (although not to that extreme). They begin with the assumption that learners already understand the benefits of a course, without having established them.</p>



<p>The reality, is that some of your learners will understand the value of your course rather quickly, but others will need more of an explanation. They might see how your course would be good for someone—but not recognize how it might help them.</p>



<h3>2. Different benefits will resonate with different learners.</h3>



<p>Another important note about benefits: They won&#8217;t be the same for everyone. Say you&#8217;re trying to teach a language course: Some learners will want to learn so that they can be prepared for a foreign trip. Others will want to enhance their business skills. Still others will have academic interests, like being able to write or appreciate foreign media.</p>



<p>Emphasizing a range of benefits that your course provides can help you attract more learners. It&#8217;s also a good way to find subsets of your audience who might have different needs. Someone learning a language for travel will have a different learning path from one who is learning for business, and you can create different materials to appeal to each.</p>



<h2>So when should sales copy focus on features?</h2>



<p>Once your learners are all-in on the benefits you offer, talking about features can help convince them to sign on. The enthusiasm a learner has for reaching a goal will make them more interested in how you plan to help them get there.</p>



<h3>1. Features will speak more meaningfully to learners who have done more research.</h3>



<p>In marketing, we often talk about the &#8220;buyer&#8217;s journey,&#8221; or the path someone takes from being uninformed about a product to being ready to buy. The stages to from &#8220;pain aware,&#8221; to &#8220;solution aware,&#8221; and finally to &#8220;brand aware.&#8221; In practice that looks like this:</p>



<p>You might never have thought about wanting to take a course in meditation, but now that you&#8217;ve seen an add talking about how many people struggle to concentrate at work, you realize this is a problem you have, too. (Pain aware.) You learn that meditation can help free the mind of distractions by providing an intentional period of rest during the busy work day. You think about reading a book or downloading an app, but ultimately decide you want to take a mediation class. (Solution aware.) You research various online courses, and eventually discover one that offers daily ten-minute lessons that will fit into your lunch break. (Brand aware.)</p>



<p>Benefits-based language helps learners recognize a need and convince them of a solution. But the further a learner goes down the buyer&#8217;s journey, they more specifics they want to know before they will make a decision.</p>



<h3>2. Features can help differentiate your course from the competition.</h3>



<p>Specifics are important because they help a learner decide between two similar options. This is where features are crucial in closing a sale. Remember that many learners, especially online, will look up at least one other option before settling on a purchase. They want to be sure that what they&#8217;re looking at is the best solution for them. If you and a competitor are both selling similar courses, you are probably also talking about similar benefits.</p>



<p>However, the specific features can be what sets you apart. If you are offering something with your course that your competitor doesn&#8217;t, it can be the deciding factor in your favor.</p>



<h3>3. Features are more concrete and specific, and that will make your benefits claims more credible.</h3>



<p>Finally, while benefits are lofty and inspirational, features show that you have the means and the method to deliver on what you promise. Benefits are the destination, features are the map.</p>



<h3>Benefits and features aren’t an “either/or” but a “both/and.” The key is when to use them.</h3>



<p>As should be clear by now, you need to show earners both the benefits of taking your course, and the features that will help them get there, if you want to land a sale. They key is to make sure benefits come first. If a learner doesn&#8217;t see the benefit, they will never care about the features. But once you&#8217;ve shown the benefit, learners need to know the features to make the final decisions. Convince learners of the benefits, and the features can back you up.</p>

<h2>It’s not enough to just build a great course—you have to sell it, too.</h2>



<p>Many online educators create courses because they have a passion and want to share it. And, of course, that’s a fantastic and inspirational thing to see. But many educators, after creating their courses, run into a wall: their excitement carried them through the creation stage of their journey, and now they need to move into sales mode. The only problem is, they don’t know how.</p>



<p>This phenomenon shouldn’t be surprising. After all, we should all be able to recognize that creating a course and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-increase-conversions-and-maximize-course-sales/">selling a course</a> are different skills, and switching hats isn’t easy.</p>



<p>What is easy is tricking yourself into thinking that a great course will sell itself. We would all like to think that our greatness is instantly recognizable, but the truth is that competition is tough, and learners are looking for something that speaks directly to their needs.</p>



<p>Good sales copy can do that. And since copy is going to be the primary way you sell your course online, taking time to do it right is worth the effort. Here’s some tips to get you started.</p>



<h3>1. Don’t write copy you don’t want to read.</h3>



<p>All of us have seen bad sales copy. It&#8217;s the kind that includes overblown promises (&#8220;opportunity of a lifetime!&#8221;) or vacuous statements (&#8220;everything you want and more!&#8221;) and generally just feels pushy and irritating to read (“don’t miss this amazing opportunity buy now!!!!!!!”). And yet, for some reason, many excellent online business owners, when they go to write their sales copy, fall into these same writing traps. Why?</p>



<p>I suspect it&#8217;s because these business owners believe on some level that they have to use this kind of writing to attract learners. They want to sell courses, and they believe that &#8220;sales-heavy&#8221; copy is the way to do it.</p>



<p>The problem is that most professional sales people don&#8217;t write that way, because irritating a customer isn’t a good sales strategy—especially when all they need to do to get away from you is to close a browser tab. If you’re writing copy you hate because you think that’s what you need to do to sell a course, it’s time to step back and re-evaluate.</p>



<h4>A few sales copywriting mistakes to avoid:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Too many vague or fluffy words.</strong> You’ll hear many people say you shouldn’t use too many adjectives or adverbs—or just too many words in general—but I don’t find this helpful. The problem isn’t the quantity of words, but the quality. Avoid puffy words (“amazing,” “incredible,” “super”), and instead chose more specific words related to your content.</li><li><strong>Too many exclamation points.</strong> Start by using none. Then, if you come back to your copy after a day and still feel like you need to add one or two, go ahead. Never use all caps in your body copy.</li><li><strong>Too many jargon words.</strong> If you’re creating an advanced course for industry professionals, technical terms are fine (and even desirable!). But if you’re writing for a new audience, using a lot of jargon words to sound impressive will be off-putting.</li><li><strong>Avoid hyperbole and clichés.</strong> Don’t make claims you can’t back up, and don’t learn on the clichés you’ve heard everyone else use. If your copy could be cut and pasted onto your competitor’s website without anyone noticing the difference, it’s not doing enough to stand out.</li><li><strong>Don’t make it all about yourself.</strong> Your learners want to know why your course is going to help them. If you aren’t speaking to their concerns, they won’t stick around to find out why you’re so special.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Choose your audience.</h3>



<p>One common mistake course creators fall into when they begin working on their course sales copy is the belief that their course is “for everyone.” The reality is that it’s not even for all the people who may be interested in learning about your subject matter.</p>



<p>This can be counterintuitive for some educators, because as teachers they want to share their knowledge with a broad audience, and as business owners they want to sell as many courses as possible. But being more selective about the kind of learner who will be a good fit for your course will actually lead to higher quality sales down the way—which in turn will mean happier learners and less stress for you.</p>



<h4>Some factors that may make a learner a good or bad fit for your course include:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Budget.</strong> Can they afford to take your course? Conversely, is your course not expensive <em>enough</em>, because they want more features and content?</li><li><strong>Involvement.</strong> Does the learner expect a lot of personal engagement with you? Some educators want to be hands off (and sell their courses to more people at a lower cost) while others want to be more like mentors (and sell fewer courses at a higher cost).</li><li><strong>Subject level.</strong> Are you teaching a beginner course, or a course for advanced students?</li><li><strong>Demographics.</strong> Are you teaching to learners of a specific age? Are race, gender, or sexual orientation relevant factors?</li></ul>



<p>Being more specific about your course actually improves your ability to sell to <em>that audience</em>, even if it means you lose out on people who don’t fall into <a href="https://www.learndash.com/do-niche-online-courses-sell/">your niche</a>. Take these two examples for a business leadership course:</p>



<ul><li>A $50 online course for recent college graduates who want to improve their hiring prospects. (Low budget, low involvement, beginning subject level, young learners.)</li><li>A $500 private online seminar for women who are preparing for a C-suite promotion. (High budget, high involvement, advanced subject level, women with 15–20 years of job experience.)</li></ul>



<p>Either of these options will naturally lead to more compelling sales copy for your online course, just by defining an audience.</p>



<h3>3. Describe your benefits first, your features second.</h3>



<p>Once you’ve defined who your audience is, start listing how your course benefits them. A lot of sales copy focuses too much on features—and features are good. But features aren’t benefits, if they don’t bring value to the learner.</p>



<p>For instance, a “feature” might be something like “daily quizzes,” “community forum,” or “one-on-one consultation.” Being specific about what your course offers is important, but only to students who are already in the market for what your course teaches. Or in other words, features are the means to an end, but unless the learner cares about the end, the means won’t matter.</p>



<p>Benefits are what your learners want to be able to achieve after they take your course. Using the example of the business leadership from before, that benefit might be something like “negotiate a higher salary” or “earn a promotion.”</p>



<p>Another way to think of this is the “why” and “how.” Benefits are the “why.” They’re the reason your learners are signing up for your course in the first place. Features are how they get there.</p>



<p>Put yet another way, benefits are the motivation, and features are the method. Learners will have varying motivations that push them to take your course, so you should think about the range of motivations, and then tie your features in to how your course will help them achieve their goals.</p>



<h4>Examples of benefits vs. features:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Benefits (motivation):</strong> Learn to speak French!<br><strong>Features (method):</strong> Daily vocabulary quizzes.<br></li><li><strong>Benefit (why):</strong> Sleep more soundly and feel more refreshed during the day.<br><strong>Feature (how):</strong> Guided meditation practices.<br></li><li><strong>Benefit (ends):</strong> Gain support from a network of fellow professionals.<br><strong>Feature (means):</strong> Community forum.</li></ul>



<h3>4. Address hesitations and offer proof.</h3>



<p>Finally, a learner may be very interested in your course, but have specific concerns that are holding them back. Maybe they’re not sure your method will work, and want to have some examples of your course in action to feel more confident. Maybe they aren’t sure they’ll be able to fit the course into their schedule, and want to know if they can get a refund if they can’t find the time to do the work. Or maybe they’re not sure the course is a good fit for them, and want a chance to talk about their needs with you before they get started.</p>



<p>There can be any number of reasons a learner might hesitate, and any number of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-earn-social-proof-for-your-online-course/">proofs</a> you can offer to set their mind at ease. You don’t need to offer everything, especially as some options are more expensive and may not be economical for you to provide. But you should consider what you can offer, and be proactive in advertising it.</p>



<h4>Ways to address hesitations and offer proof:</h4>



<ul><li>Money back guarantee during trial period.</li><li>15-minute scheduled consultation call.</li><li>Free mini course.</li><li>Learner reviews and case studies.</li></ul>



<h3>You’re going to be selling your course through your sales copy, so give it the love it deserves.</h3>



<p>Selling online education courses is a different business from many others, because your sales copy will be doing a lot more heavy lifting. Your learners are more likely to be finding you through Google or social media, and they won’t have any other frame of reference to know who you are or what you do.</p>



<p>Taking extra time to go over your copy and make sure the messaging aligns with what your learners need from your course is well worth the effort. If you put them first in your copy, you’re already well on your way to demonstrating that you’ll be putting their needs first in your course as well.</p>

<h2>How do you convince learners who have never heard of you that you’re an expert in your subject area?</h2>



<p>The biggest challenge of any course creator, once they’ve built an online course, is to get learners to sign up. Many creators fixate on questions about pricing models, advertising, marketing, and the like, convinced that all they have to do is get the right message with the right price tag in front of enough people to get them to sign up for their course.</p>



<p>But for many educators, the biggest problem is a much more difficult one to handle: Trust. Learners don’t want to risk sinking their money into a bad course. And even if that course were free, they don’t want to waste their time on it if it’s not going to teach them what they want to know.</p>



<p>Getting learners to sign up is about more than attractive messaging and a tempting price point. It’s about establishing enough trust with your learners that they believe your course will be worth their time and money. Establishing that trust is not easy, but there are several methods you can follow to win learners over. Let’s take a look.</p>



<h3>1. Show your credentials: Talk about your history.</h3>



<p>I’ve listed this option first, because it’s the first one most people think of. After all, we’re all used to handing out resumés and listing our work history when we apply for jobs, so it’s only natural this would be our first instinct when we’re trying to attract an audience.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as anyone who’s tried to break into a field knows, getting experience for your first gig can be tough. If you don’t have an established history in your field yet, convincing others that you know enough to offer meaningful instruction can be a hard sell.</p>



<p>There’s another problem with this strategy, however: It’s weak. If all a new learner has to convince them that you’re a credible teacher is your own word, they are unlikely to be persuaded. Plenty of people inflate their experience, especially on the Internet. So while your credentials may be impressive, they won’t stand well on their own. For that, you need other trust signifiers.</p>



<h3>2. Social proof: Get others to vouch for you.</h3>



<p>You can’t vouch for yourself, but if others step up and give you a good reference, you’re much more likely to win over learners. In marketing, the various ways that others can vouch for you is called “social proof.” Social proof comes in a variety of forms, including testimonials, case studies, word-of-mouth referrals, or even graduated learners offering their participation in your course as their own form of credential.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-earn-social-proof-for-your-online-course/">Social proof</a> is highly persuasive to new learners, especially if they have a strong connection with the person who is referring your course. Just think about influencer marketing. It’s a whole sales strategy built on using social media to gain social proof.</p>



<p>However, if you’re new to course creation, you’ve probably already spotted the flaw with this method: You need learners to convince other learners that your course is worthwhile. Getting that first cohort of students through your course is key to having the feedback and testimonials you need to attract more students. So what can you do to get those first learners to sign up?</p>



<h3>3. Give it away: Offer a test period.</h3>



<p>“Free” is the most magical word in marketing. When it comes to your course, you obviously don’t want to give it away for free forever. But&#8230;</p>



<p>What about a free trial period?</p>



<p>What about offering your course for free to an early round of beta testers?</p>



<p>What about a free first lesson, or a free consultation?</p>



<p>Sometimes, the biggest challenge is just to get someone to give you a shot. Once they do try your course, they may realize it’s exactly what they want, and they’ll decide to sign on in order to have more of it.</p>



<p>At the worst, you can gain feedback from them about why your course is failing—and they’ll be more likely to give that feedback if they aren’t a disappointed customer. At best? They could become one of your biggest advocates.</p>



<h3>4. Demonstrate expertise: Show that you know what you’re talking about.</h3>



<p>There’s a reason <a href="https://www.learndash.com/tips-for-creating-a-course-content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing</a> has become the most successful online strategy of the last decade: It works. And the reason why it works is because it doesn’t take learner trust for granted. Instead of withholding information and expecting learners to place their faith in you without having seen your expertise, content marketing gives learners a sense for your teaching style and underlying point of view before they sign up for a course.</p>



<p>In many ways, it’s about transparency. Many educators are worried that if they share too much up front, learners won’t sign up for their course—or their competitors will steal all their good ideas. But the reality is that your perspective is not something others can easily replicate. There’s always more to share, and doing so will only grow your brand.</p>



<p>So: talk about your subject on your blog. Make YouTube videos. Learn how to Tweet. Wherever you feel most comfortable weighing in on issues relevant to your expertise, make it your platform and start sharing your knowledge. Do it well, and you’ll have learners begging for more.</p>



<h3>Build a reputation for quality course content, and that reputation will get you far.</h3>



<p>Trust isn’t built in a day, and winning over your first satisfied learners won’t happen overnight. The best thing you can do is to never take your learner’s trust for granted, and to expect to have to earn it by building a high-quality course, listening to their feedback, and revising and updating as you go.</p>



<p>Ad campaigns vanish once they money fueling them dries up. But the efforts you put into building loyalty with your learners won’t vanish in an instant. In fact, it’s likely to continue to grow as long as you continue to produce good resources.</p>

<h2>Certification can be a valuable addition to your course offerings, but it’s not the right fit for everyone.</h2>



<p>You’ve developed an online program. What do learners get when they finish? Some course creators don’t offer anything more than a “good job” and an automated email encouraging them to sign up for the next course (maybe with a discount code!). Others send a badge that learners can add to their profile. And still others offer a full-fledged certificate of completion to verify that a learner has completed training.</p>



<p>This last option has the most gravitas, and can be highly sought in professional circles. Certification is a valuable way for learners to showcase their achievements and boost their professional credentials. But it’s not the right move for everyone, and making the right choice for your course may not be obvious.</p>



<p>So, is offering <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/certificate-builder/">certification</a> a valuable marketing tool or unnecessary red tape? Here’s how to tell.</p>



<h3>1. Is there already a certification standard in your field?</h3>



<p>Before you start a certification course—or add certification to an existing course—you should start with some market research. Is there already a well-established source for certification in your industry? What reputation does it have? Are there others in your industry offering competing certification, or is this source the gold standard?</p>



<p>Competition is a good thing, but there are definitely some instances where the market simply doesn’t have space for another certification course. This is usually because there’s already a single well-regarded source for certification. Ironically, the more competing certification programs there are, the more likely you can set yourself up as a valid alternative.</p>



<h3>2. Are you accredited, or can you become accredited?</h3>



<p>Let’s be clear: you don’t need to be accredited to offer an online certificate. Accreditation is a way for an outside body to certify your certification course, and as such, it provides a great deal of value for course creators and learners alike. However, you don’t need it, and in some cases, there may not even be a way for you to become accredited, if there’s no outside body qualified to do so.</p>



<p>If you are unaccredited, then the value of your certification will rest on your own brand. If your brand is strong and well-regarded in the industry, than a certificate becomes your official sign-off that a learner has completed your training. If your training course is good, then people may come to recognize that sign-off as enough.</p>



<p>However, if you’re relatively unknown, than accreditation can be a way for another institution to vouch for the quality of your course. There are professional bodies that do this, as well as universities. The downside to this is that gaining accreditation means you have to meet their standards—and that may mean altering your course in ways you don’t like. If doing so is worthwhile to you, then accreditation is a sensible step for increasing your course value.</p>



<h3>3. Will certification from your program be valuable to your learners?</h3>



<p>No two industries are alike, especially when it comes to certification. Some fields are tightly regulated, with extremely high professional standards, and an expectation that professionals will take continuing education courses to maintain their standing. Other fields are more like the wild west: the only proof anyone cares about is what a learner can do.</p>



<p>In general, certification is more valuable in fields where competency is harder to assess, or where the risks of failure are high. Auto mechanics seek certification, for instance, to prove that they know how to keep a vehicle roadworthy. An illustrator, on the other hand, relies on their portfolio of work to prove their skill rather than certification.</p>



<p>If you’re in an industry where ongoing education is mandatory (finance, medicine, etc.), then becoming accredited and offering certification has particular value for your learners. If certification isn’t the standard in your industry, and if it doesn’t help your learners market their skills any better, then it’s probably not worth it.</p>



<h3>4. Will certification boost your credibility or offer a competitive advantage?</h3>



<p>Finally, certification can boost the credibility of your learners, but it can boost your own credibility, too. Offering certification as part of your online course—even if you’re not accredited—can establish your authority over your competitors.</p>



<p>That said, this strategy only works if you’ve actually put the work into generating a high quality certification course. Just slapping a certificate onto your program won’t be impressive unless you’ve done the work to back it up. In many cases, certification can boost <em>perceived</em> credibility because it also boosts <em>actual</em> credibility. People see you as a more authoritative source because you put in the work to be so.</p>



<h3>You don’t need certification to offer a valuable online course, but it can be the cherry on top.</h3>



<p>Some courses aren’t about proving your credentials to others—they’re about personal fulfillment and self-satisfaction. While certification may be attractive and valuable to some, for others it would seem misplaced or even silly. After all, if I’ve just finished your online baking course in cupcake design, I don’t need something showing that I’m not a certified cupcake designer.</p>



<p>In short, certification is so you learners can prove their credentials to others. But a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/14-badge-ideas-to-engage-and-motivate-learners/">badge</a> or other mark of achievement is about personal accomplishment. You should offer your learners some token of completion when they reach a significant milestone—whether that’s a badge, some personal feedback, or a certificate is entirely up to you.</p>

<h2>What is social proof, and why do you need it for your marketing?</h2>



<p>One of the greatest challenges for any business when trying to win over new customers lies in convincing them that they are a worthwhile investment. Most consumers have natural hesitations about making a purchase, particularly when what they&#8217;re buying comes with a high price tag or a significant time commitment. That&#8217;s a good thing for them, but it&#8217;s challenging for you.</p>



<p>When considering ways to address the problem of trust in marketing, your first instinct might be to start talking about how trustworthy you are and what a great course you have to offer. Unfortunately, doing so usually strikes a false note. The next best thing is to start informing the consumer—by writing a blog, creating high-quality downloadable resources, or through video tutorials—so that they can learn for themselves why your course is worth their time and money.</p>



<p>However, <strong>nothing wins over a hesitant customer like a satisfied customer</strong>. When someone without a stake in the game, who shares the concerns and aspirations of your prospective learners, and who has made the same decision they&#8217;re facing speaks up and says &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I made that decision because it worked and I had a good experience,&#8221;&#8230;well! What else is there to say?</p>



<p>In marketing terms, these kinds of remarks are called &#8220;social proof.&#8221; They take the burden of proving the worth of your program off your shoulders, and they place it in the hands of people who are willing to back you up out of sheer good will. It&#8217;s a great tool to use in your marketing, but it can be hard to come by. Here are five different kinds of social proof, and how you can earn it from your learners.</p>



<h3>1. Reviews</h3>



<p>When someone completes your course, prompt them to leave a review at the end. Reviews are most convincing when they are public and unfiltered. They&#8217;re even more convincing when they&#8217;re tied to an external profile, such as Facebook.</p>



<p>Some people are anxious about allowing public reviews on their course, because they worry that a negative comment could damage their image. And they&#8217;re not entirely wrong: a slew of angry reviews will hurt. But a wall of five-star reviews hurts, too, because it raises questions about the integrity of the review system.</p>



<p>So, don&#8217;t panic if you get a few negative ratings. It will make the good ones seem more genuine, and you can always learn from someone&#8217;s bad experience.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> We get a lot of our review from <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/130248/LearnDash/reviews/">Capterra</a>, and publish the best ones on our social media. Hearing what our happiest customers have to say about us frequently makes our day.</p>



<h3>2. Testimonials</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-get-and-use-testimonials-to-sell-your-course/">testimonial</a> is like a review, but it is one you usually have to solicit personally. If you have a lot of reviews coming in from learners, you may not need to collect any. But if reviews are slow, or if you&#8217;re just getting started, try asking learners or beta testers if they might have a kind word to share about their experience. Let them know that you&#8217;d like to put it on your website and other marketing materials, and ask if you can use their name.</p>



<p>Also, pay attention to positive comments that people make spontaneously. If someone says something great about you in an email, follow up by asking if you can share that on your site. Something as simple as &#8220;Wow, thanks for that! Do you mind if we use that in a testimonial on our site?&#8221; is all you need, and almost everyone says yes. It&#8217;s a great way to get an authentic comment from someone, and they didn&#8217;t have to stop to compose anything themselves.</p>



<h3>3. Case Studies</h3>



<p>Case studies are the most sought after kind of social proof for many businesses. A good case study lets you tell a longer, detailed story about someone&#8217;s experience. The format means you can ask more detailed questions, offer some background on the learner, and follow up about any positive results they gained from achieving certification.</p>



<p>That said, good case studies take extra work to develop. You need to find a learner who will consent to work with you, find time to interview them, and then edit their story into something that&#8217;s attractive and worth sharing. It&#8217;s well worth the effort if you can pull it off, but doing so takes thoughtfulness and persistence.</p>



<p>If you want to write a good case study, keep an eye out for the right candidates. Focus on learners you have established some rapport with, and ask them if they&#8217;d be willing to be interviewed shortly after they complete the course. Make sure they know what you plan to use the case study for, and what the time commitment will be on their part. Be prepared to write it quickly and send it to them for approval. If you can catch people quickly and turn them around fast, you can start building up a collection of case studies from a wide range of learners.</p>



<h3>4. Social Sharing</h3>



<p>Reviews that appear on your website are great social proof for visitors, but social media sharing amplifies that message for people who may not have heard of you yet. Unlike publishing your reviews in your own social channels, which we mentioned earlier, social sharing is about getting your learners to spontaneously share about you in their own channels.</p>



<p>For instance, when your learners complete something in your course, make it easy for them to share it with their network. An enthusiastic student may be eager to share their progress, and in doing so may introduce one of their friends to your course. Word of mouth is a powerful thing.</p>



<h3>5. Badges and Certification</h3>



<p>Having learners post about a test score or a new achievement in their news feeds is excellent, but news feeds are fleeting, and whatever buzz they generate will fade. But what about giving learners something to post in their profiles, where it will be more permanent? On platforms such as LinkedIn, or other online resumes, a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/badgeos/">badge</a> or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/certificate-builder/">official certificate</a> can be a permanent way for learners to share their achievement.</p>



<p>When learners add their badge or certification credentials to their social media profiles, those credentials stay there for any visitor to see. They might not even remember it&#8217;s there after a while, but their endorsement will remain.</p>



<h3>Social proof is more convincing than anything you can say about yourself.</h3>



<p>Adding the right functions to allow for social sharing, badges, and course reviews may take a little time to set up. But any effort you put into it will be paid back many times by the positive affect of a learner leaving their seal of approval on your course. So, instead of wondering how to convince new learners that your course is worthwhile, turn the microphone over to learners who have already completed it. Their satisfaction will amplify your message far better than you could ever do on your own.</p>

<h2>Your learners have completed your course. How do you retain their interest in your program?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a truism in the marketing industry that it&#8217;s harder and more expensive to find new customers than to retain the ones you have. This is why so many businesses devote substantial resources to growing customer satisfaction. However, in online education, it&#8217;s all too easy for recipients to get what they came for and walk out the door never to be seen or heard from again.</p>



<p>Growing a customer base with that kind of business model is a challenge, but it&#8217;s not impossible, especially if you’re marketing to a professional industry where learners have ongoing education requirements. However, relying on your learners to automatically choose your course again can be a gamble, especially if you have competitors who might be offering something new and exciting that your learners haven’t tried before. Instead, course creators should find ways to retain learners so that they keep coming back for more—and maybe even spread the word to their friends and family.</p>



<p>Looking for inspiration? Here are 7 ways to engage your learners and build customer loyalty.</p>



<h3>1. Advanced certification.</h3>



<p>Many professions offer progression models so that workers have a clear path to follow if they want to progress in their career. Just as a college offers 100-level classes to first-year students and 400-level classes to seniors, you could consider advanced certification programs for learners that have already passed certain prerequisites.</p>



<p>For instance, you could offer your program to learners who have already passed one of your courses, possess a similar level of certification from one of your competitors, or have a certain number of years&#8217; experience in their trade. This will be a smaller pool than those just starting out, but it&#8217;s also a niche market that is potentially underserved in your industry. Launch an advanced certificate, and you might even draw learners away from the competition.</p>



<h3>2. Micro courses.</h3>



<p>Advanced courses explore a subject more narrowly, but micro courses offer a chance to go broad rather than deep. Maybe your course on SEO could benefit from a micro certification in local SEO. Learners who graduated your main course could come back for the supplementary material, those who are currently taking your course could take it as an add-on, and anyone on the fence could try it out without committing to the full course. Micro courses provide a flexible way to add to the value of your program, and are easier to develop than another full course.</p>



<h3>3. Focused webinars.</h3>



<p>Like micro courses, webinars create an opportunity for learners to engage with material in a new way. They also allow you to connect more personally with your audience. Through a webinar, you can respond to learner questions, create a discussion, and incorporate up-to-the-minute material more rapidly than through a course. And if you record your webinar, you can share it later with learners who weren&#8217;t able to attend.</p>



<h3>4. Content marketing.</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/tips-for-creating-a-course-content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing</a>, but if you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a way of building customer trust and loyalty through high-value content such as blogs, podcasts, a video series, or downloadable PDFs.</p>



<p>Content marketing is usually presented as a way to recruit new learners. By writing articles and producing other audio/video material, you give your audience a way to connect with your material, learn about your field, and get a sense of your instructional style. But you also provide a valuable resource for your learners to return to for new insight and information. As long as you keep that connection alive, you have a chance to convince those learners to come back for new courses.</p>



<h3>7. Community.</h3>



<p>We’ve talked about this many times before, but learners frequently turn to online courses <a href="https://www.learndash.com/are-you-selling-courses-or-community/">for community</a> as much as for the material you have to teach. Giving learners a place where they can connect with each other as they work toward their learning goals is a powerful way to keep them engaged with your learning website.</p>



<p>If you don’t have the resources to build a forum yet, you can also create a community on social media. LinkedIn and Facebook both offer private, invite-only groups. What if you created a group for everyone who completed a course from your program to join? Doing so would create a networking opportunity for members, and it would keep your program front of mind.</p>



<h3>6. Newsletter.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re doing half of any of the above, you should create a newsletter so that you can share all this information with your learners. The newsletter doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy. In fact, it can be as simple as offering to email subscribers new blog posts when they come out, as well as any news on courses as they become available. But if you&#8217;re going to do a newsletter, plan on making it at least monthly, if not weekly. Otherwise, your learners are likely to forget they signed up for it and are more likely to leave your emails unread.</p>



<h3>7. Resource library.</h3>



<p>Over the course of developing your online course, you&#8217;ve doubtless accumulated various resources, original or otherwise. You probably can&#8217;t share everything for copyright reasons, but anything in the public domain—and certainly anything you&#8217;ve developed yourself, could be compiled into a resource library for your learners.</p>



<p>That could include infographics, helpful YouTube videos, white papers, PDFs, or even e-books. And for those resources you can&#8217;t share for free, you could still offer links to books and articles so that your learners know where to go for more information. This isn&#8217;t as dynamic an option as some of the others we&#8217;ve mentioned, but it still has the potential to provide value to your learners, and it&#8217;s relatively easy to assemble.</p>



<h3>Use your course to cultivate lifelong learners.</h3>



<p>If there&#8217;s any unifying theme from the ideas we&#8217;ve presented above, it&#8217;s that learning doesn&#8217;t stop when your learners finish a course. Instead, it&#8217;s an ongoing process that learners should re-engage with throughout their lives. If that&#8217;s the case, there should be plenty of benefits to learners in remaining with your program, even after they complete their first course. All you have to do is give them a reason to stay.</p>

<h2>How do you know if there is a market for your specialized online course?</h2>



<p>One of the biggest struggles first-time educators face when they launch a new course lies in <a href="https://www.learndash.com/choosing-a-topic-for-your-course/">finding a promising subject</a>. They may have an idea that inspires them, but it&#8217;s less certain whether that idea will appeal to anyone else. As a result, the temptation for these course providers is to go broad. With such a wide market, they can&#8217;t help but earn some slice of the pie, right?</p>



<p>The reality is that, by choosing a less-specific subject, they become more generic, and their course becomes lost in a sea of other, similar courses. They may muddle along, but it will be harder to achieve the kind of success they actually aspire to.</p>



<p>On the other hand, by refining a course topic and settling on a niche idea, they stand a better chance of establishing their place as an expert on that subject. There are obviously some pros and cons to choosing a niche idea, but overall it&#8217;s a gamble that&#8217;s likely to pay off. Here&#8217;s why.</p>



<h3>Pro: People identify with a niche course more than with a generic one.</h3>



<p>Niche course ideas resonate more than generic ones. The more refined your idea is, the more that audience will feel your course was designed with them in mind.</p>



<p>And, in a way, it is. By defining your niche, you&#8217;re sending a strong signal to like-minded people that you have something that will fit what they&#8217;re searching for. You could have a course that teaches almost exactly the same thing as one of your competitors, but if you&#8217;ve branded yourself as having created the course for a specific group, members of that group are more likely to sign on.</p>



<h3>Con: A niche online course, by definition, has a smaller market.</h3>



<p>That said, a niche course will have a smaller market than a generic one—that&#8217;s what being &#8220;niche&#8221; means. The key is to ensure you don&#8217;t become overly restricted by the size of your market. If you have an idea for a hyper-specific course, wait until you&#8217;ve grown an audience through your other online programs first, then market your hyper-specific course as a micro course to current students.</p>



<h3>Pro: A smaller market gives you the chance to be a big fish in a small pond.</h3>



<p>If there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any huge players in your niche already, it pays to research market demand for your course. It could be that a few small courses do exist, but that no one has yet cornered the market. In the meantime, maybe you&#8217;ve found a lot of discussion in blogs and online forums indicating an unmet interest.</p>



<p>This is an ideal scenario for your course idea. It means you have an opportunity to establish yourself as the program in the industry for your topic. In that case, your market may be small, but you have space to dominate.</p>



<h3>Con: Niche markets can only sustain so many big fish.</h3>



<p>If there&#8217;s already an established industry leader in your niche market, that could indicate a few things: either the market is saturated, and you&#8217;ll have a tough time competing, or there&#8217;s a strong demand in your niche for online programs, and you can fill that need.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering which scenario applies to you, ask yourself: how is your course different from the industry leader? If you can&#8217;t identify ways in which your course is substantially different, then you&#8217;ll probably be perceived as a copy-cat rather than a thought leader. On the other hand, if you have a strong reason to believe that your course brings something new and valuable to the market, then that&#8217;s a positive sign to proceed.</p>



<h3>Pro: It’s unlikely your niche course idea has reached market saturation.</h3>



<p>Not to be too optimistic, but the market for online programs is only growing. The percentage of the American population with access to broadband Internet it their homes is steadily increasing, and the same is true in other parts of the world as well. This has been accompanied by a rise in the proportion of people who feel comfortable using technology in their day-to-day lives.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, online courses have become an increasingly common way for workers to improve their employment prospects and earning potential. In many cases, organizations use online certification in place of more formal employee training, making it a familiar part of modern work environments.</p>



<p>This is all fantastic news for anyone hoping to launch a certification program or any other kind of course. The market is strong, and it&#8217;s only growing stronger.</p>



<h3>Show your audience the value of your course, price it reasonably, and yes, it will sell.</h3>



<p>The bottom line is: if you&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-vet-your-online-course-idea/">done your homework</a> and identified an online market for your niche, there&#8217;s no reason to believe your topic is too specific. Too many people approach their topic with the idea that &#8220;niche&#8221; means you&#8217;re about to launch a certification course in alpaca farming (although, for the record, it is possible to become a certified fiber sorter).</p>



<p>Unless you&#8217;re actually proposing a highly outlandish online program, you&#8217;ve probably hit upon your course idea because you&#8217;re already part of an interested community. You&#8217;re not alone in your interest, and where there is interest, there&#8217;s a market.</p>



<p>If you’re having trouble selling your course, chances are it has more to do with your value proposition than your niche. Your course needs to connect with a specific end result. A vague promise that your course participants will “learn more” is less captivating than that they will achieve a qualification that will help them advance in a career, or that they will reach a certain goal, or gain a new skill.</p>



<p>So, rather than worrying about your niche, focus on your value proposition. What do learners stand to gain from taking your course? And how much will they be willing to invest toward achieving it? Figure out those puzzle pieces, and your course will take you far.</p>

<h2>Online education for younger learners is a growing market segment, but requires special management tools for parents.</h2>



<p>The youth market for online education has been growing steadily over the past decade, even before Covid–19 turned remote learning into a daily experience for many families around the world, and it’s not hard to understand why. Parents are always looking for new ways to make “screen time” more educational. Teachers are using “blended learning” to integrate in-person learning with take-home assignments. And kids and teenagers often have their own learning interests, too.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/online-learning-for-children-and-young-adults/">creating courses for young learners</a> is not the same as creating courses for adults. For one thing, children and young adults have different learning abilities, motivations, and preferences. And for another, the parents of young learners usually have to be involved.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it is possible to offer parents tools for monitoring their children in an online course so that they can track progress and keep up with their kids’ assignments, while also reducing the administrative burden on your end. Here’s how.</p>



<h3>How to offer parental controls for your online course.</h3>



<p>First of all, some courses don’t need extensive parental controls. For instance, if you’re selling a course for young children who can’t use a device unassisted, parents will already be the primary account holders. Similarly, if parents are signing their older teenagers up for a course, they may not need or want to be monitoring that student’s progress. Or, if they need, to, they can sign in to their child’s account to check progress.</p>



<p>If you do want more advanced options, however, there are three main options available to you: use <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/users-groups/groups/group-users-and-group-leaders/">LearnDash’s native Groups settings</a>, install a 3rd party plugin, or use custom development.</p>



<h4>1. LearnDash’s native Groups function.</h4>



<p>For parents who only need a basic ability to monitor their child’s progress, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-learndash-to-create-a-wordpress-membership-site/">LearnDash’s Groups function</a> that can do just that. As a course creator, you would make each parent a Group Leader, and then assign their children to them as Group Users.</p>



<p>The Group Leader function would let parents view course progress, as well as see reports on quiz performance. It’s important, if using this option, to make sure you have the correct settings and permissions set. You’ll only want to give parents basic capabilities over their groups so that they can manage their children but no one else’s.</p>



<p>That said, the Groups function is primarily designed as a management tool for leaders with larger teams to manage. It can work well for small parent/child courses, but can be clumsy on a large scale.</p>



<h4>2. Parent and Child Access.</h4>



<p>Our recommended solution for most use cases is <a href="https://immerseus.com/parent-access-for-learndash/">Parent and Child Access</a>, which is a 3rd party plugin from Immerseus eLearning.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Link parent account and child accounts.</strong> This can be done in the WP Admin by the admin, or on the front-end by the parent. For large organizations, allowing parents to complete the linking step can save your administrative team a lot of effort.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Monitor each child individually.</strong> Allows parents to see whether a course is started, course progress, lessons taken, quizzes, taken, quiz scores, and certificates.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="337" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1024x337.png" alt="A screenshot of the Parent and Child Access plugin showing that a student has not started a course." class="wp-image-28382" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1024x337.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-300x99.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-768x252.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1536x505.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1800x592.png 1800w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-500x164.png 500w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Parents can check progress for courses, lessons, quizzes, and certificates.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Sell courses to the parent.</strong> Using both WooCommerce and the built-in LearnDash selling methods, you can sell courses directly to parents and then let them link their own child accounts.</li></ul>



<p>There are a number of other plugins on the market that offer membership controls, but Parent and Child Access is the only one built specifically for LearnDash with parental controls in mind. Their solution also works for management teams in organizations, so it’s really worth looking into if you have an internal training application in mind.</p>



<h4>3. Custom development.</h4>



<p>Finally, there is the tried-and-true custom development solution. If your organization has the both the budget for this and a very specific use case in mind, this is the best option. However, the down side of custom development is that it is expensive, and you’ll need to continue to maintain it for yourself. Before you start a custom development project, research you options and be sure that the custom functions you need can’t be covered by the solutions already available.</p>



<h3>Benefits of parent controls in a K–12 online course.</h3>



<p>Offering parents better access to their children’s courses is good for parents, teachers, and young learners. It empowers parents by giving them better insights into their children’s learning progress, it reduces administrative work for teachers, and it helps learners perform better both in person and online. Specifically, these benefits include:</p>



<ul><li>Allowing parents to manage their children’s enrollment reduces the administrative burden of managing an online course.</li><li>Teachers can assign in-class homework which can be completed and submitted at home.</li><li>Online quizzes can provide automatic grading and feedback without adding to teacher workloads.</li><li>Learners can complete extra practice quizzes at home to become more confident in a subject before a big test.</li><li>Parents can check up on their child’s progress anywhere and at any time.</li><li>Greater parental access to student progress can improve communication with teachers.</li><li>Parents can sign their kids up for extracurricular courses that aren’t available it their school.</li></ul>



<h3>Parent access can make the learner experience of online K–12 education better for everyone.</h3>



<p>Over the past year, online education for children and young adults has been rough, and parents are exhausted. Part of what has made this transition difficult, however, has been the abrupt roll-out and lack of support for parents and teachers alike. Offering better tools to help parents stay up to date with their children’s coursework can reduce strain for parents and teachers alike.</p>



<p>Having better tools is important because K–12 online education isn’t going anywhere. The pandemic has seen schools pour resources into technology for students that has expanded Internet access and the availability of computers and tablets to young learners around the world. Furthermore, parents, kids, and educators are all now more familiar with this technology than they were prior to the pandemic.</p>



<p>Once online education is no longer a necessity, many will discover which aspects they want to keep for future learning. Good management tools that empower parents are sure to be one of them.</p>

<h2>Whether you’re feeling overwhelmed or looking for inspiration, here’s a place to start.</h2>



<p>For a lot of course creators, marketing is a love it or hate it activity. It takes time, thoughtfulness, and a lot of brainpower to do right, and it can be discouraging if your efforts don’t seem to be paying off. However, if you’re serious about building your online course, there’s no way around it: this is not an “if you build it they will come” situation. You have to get out there and tell people about your course if you expect to grow an audience.</p>



<p>How do you do that? Here are a few ways.</p>



<h3>1. Flesh out some landing pages on your website.</h3>



<p>When someone comes to your website, what’s the first page they land on? Here’s a surprise: It may not be your home page! A lot of home page visits come from people who already know your brand. They searched for your name online, they followed a link from your social profile page, or they went directly to your web address from your business card.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a lot of organic traffic will land on your site through some other page—a blog post or a product page, for instance. You can capture and retain more of this traffic if you design pages for specific audiences, and then optimize them for more search traffic. To rank, these pages will need to have a lot of text, as well as images, headers, and other rich content (infographics and videos, for instance). Give them love, and position some nice calls-to-action to encourage them to sign up to your course or newsletter.</p>



<h3>2. Write a piece of high-value content and give it away in exchange for email addresses.</h3>



<p>Another way to grow leads (meaning: grow a list of people who have given you their email address because they like your content) is to create a high-value PDF download. This may be an infographic, a worksheet, an article—whatever you like! Just so long as it’s something that will feel “worth it” to your visitors after they go through the trouble of downloading it.</p>



<p>Once your content piece is made, gate it by putting it behind a download form. Ask for a name and email address, and include a check box to ask if you can send them more marketing materials, such as your newsletter or other offers. (Note: For EU users especially, asking permission is essential for staying on the right side of GDPR compliance.)</p>

<h3>3. Begin a blog and include an email sign-up form.</h3>



<p>Designing landing pages is important for your most valuable key terms, but your blog is another important gateway to your site where each page is its own landing page, of sorts. Blogging lets you touch on a rage of niche topics, and over time, it becomes its own valuable resource of content. Be sure to link to your old posts so that prospective learners will stay on your site, and include an email form for your newsletter to retain interested learners.</p>



<h3>4. Email your list regularly with well-designed, thoughtful content.</h3>



<p>There’s a lot of resistance to email newsletters, mostly because a lot of people feel tired and overwhelmed by bad email marketing content. But at the same time, email content that’s <em>good</em> is often popular. There are some newsletters out there with dedicated readers who will swear by it as a resource. That’s the kind of newsletter you want to create.</p>



<p>Remember, people who gave you their email address and agreed to receive your newsletter want to be contacted by you. They want your resource to be a good one. All you have to do is deliver quality as promised.</p>



<h3>5. Choose a couple social media channels that fit your niche and get active.</h3>



<p>You don’t have to be on every social channel. Your audience won’t be everywhere, and you don’t want to waste your energy where it won’t do you any good. But if there’s a channel where you feel comfortable and where you think you can grow an audience, start creating posts.</p>



<p>Remember that each channel is different, and that you may find your audiences on each channel are unique. Audiences on Facebook tend to skew older, and are more likely to comment. Instagram uses a lot of hashtags, and it is worth your time to research which ones are popular for your area. Twitter works best for people who want to build a personal brand, but it takes a lot of savvy to maintain. Choose wisely and be careful where you put your energy.</p>



<h3>6. Put ad money behind your best social posts.</h3>



<p>You can draw more attention to your social media content by “boosting” social posts. You don’t want to do this with every post, but it’s a good idea for special announcements or extra valuable content.</p>



<p>You can also create ads designed to link back to your site’s landing pages. Depending on the social channel, your targeting tools can narrow down those who see your ads to very specific audiences, letting you run niche ads with high conversion rates.</p>



<h3>7. Build networking opportunities at events.</h3>



<p>As you break into your industry, you can raise your profile by reaching out to others in your network. It is hard to do this via cold email (I’ve discarded enough requests to know), but it is possible with personal connections.</p>



<p>Industry events—whether in person or online—are one way to do this. Social media is another avenue. If you’re building connections on Twitter, for instance, you might be able to reach out to someone with whom you’ve had a positive interaction to work on something together. You might ask about guest blogging on each other’s sites. WordCamps, for those in the WordPress sphere, offer opportunities to pitch speaking topic. Do a good job, and you might find someone who wants to interview you for their podcast.</p>



<p>Your own industry may have similar events where speakers can submit topics, although in most cases this is done by invitation. Avoid anyone who is asking you to pay them for an opportunity to speak at their event.</p>



<h3>What NOT to do.</h3>



<p>Finally, there are lots of ways you can go wrong with online marketing, mostly by following bad advice from pushy, old school sales tactics. The Internet is a different space, where most people are quick to block you, mark your emails as spam, or report your content for violating forum rules. If you don’t want to find yourself black listed, here are a few major don’ts.</p>



<ul><li><strong>DON’T start hijacking other people’s content channels.</strong> This includes their blog, their social media channels, and their private forums.</li><li><strong>DON’T spam professional groups with your course.</strong> Speaking of hijacking forums, don’t do this on professional groups, either. Groups on Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Quora are especially quick to call out self-promotion.</li><li><strong>DON’T start adding everyone you know to your email lists.</strong> Email marketing tools&nbsp; will blacklist you if too many people mark your emails as spam.</li><li><strong>DON’T throw your ad money after generic key terms.</strong> High profile key terms are expensive, and often have low conversion rates. Focus on niche terms that are easier to win.</li></ul>



<h3>Online marketing takes time, so start early and be consistent.</h3>



<p>The best online marketing focuses on the long term. Reputations online have staying power, and if you start off with bad tactics that focus on the hard sell or make you look unprofessional you may have trouble ever getting off the ground.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you focus on quality from the beginning and demonstrate your expertise through your marketing from day one, you will not only capture the attention of the people you most want to attract, you will keep them around for the long term.</p>
